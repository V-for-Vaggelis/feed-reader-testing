# Feed Reader Testing project

The feed reader testing project, was about creating unit tests, for a feed reader website that was built by Udacity and can be found in <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader">this github repository</a>. This website basically  provides the user with different links about a topic. The user can choose 1 of 4 different topics by clicking on the "hamburger icon" on the left top. When a different topic is selected the links  change. My job was to write some tests, with the Jasmine library to ensure that everything works as it is supposed to in the website. My code is in the following file: "jasmine/spec/feedreader.js".

</ul>

## How to run

The website should load on any browser. **The tests will not show if you access this website online**. To view the tests you'll have to clone the current repository on your local machine and just open the "index.html" file with your favorite browser. The Jasmine framework should load automatically, and all the tests should be displayed as "passed". Please report any issues.
