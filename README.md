# Feed Reader Testing project

The feed reader testing project, was about creating unit tests, for a feed reader website that was built by Udacity and can be found in <a href="https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader">this github repository</a>. This website basically  provides the user with different links about a topic. The user can choose 1 of 4 different topics by clicking on the "hamburger icon" on the left top. When a different topic is selected the links  change. My job was to write some tests, with the Jasmine library to ensure that everything works as it is supposed to in the website. My code is located in the following file: "jasmine/spec/feedreader.js".
